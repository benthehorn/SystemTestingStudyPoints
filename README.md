# SystemTestingStudyPoints
These are the exercises we have made using jMeter for the interest and discount methods in the bank code.

IMPORTANT
  make sure that CSV Data Set Config Interest points to interestCSV.csv
  
  and that CSV Data Set Config Discount points to DiscountCSV.csv.
  
  Otherwise it won't work, if it works at all....
